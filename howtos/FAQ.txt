Incorrect number of fields at chr1:1234567::

[#incorrect-nfields]
This error is triggered when the number of values in the data line does not match
its definition in the header.
A common error is to define a tag with variable number of fields
(such as `Number=G` or `Number=A` or `Number=R` in the header) and output incorrect
number of values at multiallelic the data lines.  The number of values
must correspond to the number of alleles as explained in the section 1.4.2 of the link:http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf[VCF specification].

_How to verify and fix:_ +
Look up the tag definition in the header (`bcftools view -H file.vcf.gz | grep TAG`) to check the expected number
of values and then check the number of alleles and values in the data line (`bcftools view -h file.vcf.gz -r chr1:1234567`).
Note that the program only works with ploidy 1 or 2, so if defined as `Number=G` and the ploidy is bigger,
the program will fail.
If the tag is not important for your analysis, a quick and dirty workaround is to remove the
tag from the VCF completely (`bcftools annotate -x TAG`).

Plugins
-------

IMPORTANT: In order to use the BCFtools plugins, this environment variable must
be set and point to the correct location: +
``export BCFTOOLS_PLUGINS=/path/to/bcftools/plugins`` +
If a  plugin still does not work, ``bcftools +name -vv`` explains why it would not load.

=== For developers

Please read link:plugin.api.html[here].


=== List of plugins

ad-bias:: Finds positions with ALT allele frequency significantly different
    between two samples. Performs a Fisher test on the FORMAT/AD annotation.

link:plugin.af-dist.html[af-dist]:: Collects AF deviation stats and GT probability distribution given AF and assuming HWE

check-ploidy:: Checks if ploidy of samples is consistent for all sites.

check-sparsity:: Prints samples without genotypes in a region (-r/-R) or chromosome (the default)

color-chrs:: Colors shared chromosomal segments shared. Requires phased GTs.

counts:: A minimal plugin which counts number of samples, SNPs, INDELs, MNPs and total number of sites.

dosage:: Prints genotype dosage determined from FORMAT/PL, GL, or GT.

fill-from-fasta:: Fills INFO or REF field based on values in a fasta file.

link:plugin.fill-tags.html[fill-tags]:: Sets INFO tags such as AF, AC, AC_Hemi, etc, for all samples or per population.

fixploidy:: Fix ploidy

link:plugin.fixref.html[fixref]:: Diagnose and fix VCFs with genotypes on incorrect strand.

frameshifts:: Annotates frameshift indels.

GTisec:: Counts genotype intersections across all possible sample subsets in a vcf file.

GTsubset:: Outputs sites where the requested samples all exclusively share a genotype (GT), i.e.
    all selected samples must have the same GT, while non of the others can have it.

guess-ploidy:: Determines sample sex by checking genotype likelihoods (GL,PL) or genotypes (GT) in the non-PAR region of chrX.

impute-info:: Adds imputation information metrics to the INFO field based on selected FORMAT tags. Only the IMPUTE2 INFO metric from FORMAT/GP tags is currently available.

isecGT:: Compares two files and set non-identical genotypes in the first file to missing.

link:plugin.mendelian.html[mendelian]:: Count Mendelian consistent / inconsistent genotypes

prune:: Prunes sites by missingness or linkage disequilibrium.

setGT:: Sets genotypes according to the specified criteria and filtering expressions. For example, missing genotypes can be set to ref, but much more than that.

tag2tag:: Converts between similar tags, such as GL, PL and GP.

trio-switch-rate:: Calculates phase switch rate in trio children.

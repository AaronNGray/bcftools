Plugin fixref
-------------

This tool helps to determine and fix strand orientation.
Currently it can collect and print numbers useful in determining
the strand convention (the `stats` mode), flip non-ambiguous SNPs (the `flip` mode),
or convert from the 
link:http://www.illumina.com/documents/products/technotes/technote_topbot.pdf[Illumina TOP strand]
convention to the forward strand (the `top` mode).

Run the stats to learn the number of REF allele mismatches and the number of 
non-biallelic sites:
----
bcftools +fixref test.bcf -- -f ref.fa
----

If there are no REF mismatches and the number of multi-allelic sites is small, we are done.
If the output shows that the VCF is TOP-compatible, the following command can be
used to fix the strand:
----
bcftools +fixref test.bcf -Ob -o output.bcf -- -f ref.fa -m top
----

In the most extreme case when nothing else is working, one can simply force
the unambigous alleles onto the forward strand and drop the ambigous genotypes.
----
bcftools +fixref test.bcf -Ob -o output.bcf -- -f ref.fa -m flip -d
----
Note that this is an extremely unsafe operation and can result in nonsense 
genotypes. If you decide to use it, make sure to check the sanity of the
result with the link:plugin.af-dist.html[af-dist plugin].

WARNING: Do not use the program blindly, make an effort to understand what
strand convention your data uses! Make sure the reason for mismatching REF
alleles is not a different reference build!!

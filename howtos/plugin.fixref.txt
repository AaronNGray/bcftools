If you are reading this page, your VCF probably has incorrect REF alleles. This can
be easy to fix, but it also can turn out to be quite problematic. In order to appreciate
the problem, consider the following example. Let's say your VCF contains these records:

This problem can be easy to fix, if you know the strand convention of your VCF.
For example

Before
you start copy and pasting the commands below, please think 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?searchType=adhoc_search&type=rs&rs=rs2980319
$bt query -i'(REF="A" && ALT="T") || (REF="T" && ALT="A")' -f'%CHROM:%POS\t%ID\t%REF\t%ALT[\t%GT]\n' /nfs/users/nfs_p/pd3/sandbox/tmp/rmme/rmme-iserver-fixref/plink.raw.bcf -s 1328_NA06989,1377_NA11891,1349_NA11843 | head

This tool helps to determine and fix strand orientation.
Currently it can collect and print numbers useful in determining
the strand convention (the `stats` mode), swap REF/ALT alleles based on the 
SNP reference ID (the `id` mode), 
flip or swap non-ambiguous SNPs (the `flip` mode),
or convert from the 
link:http://www.illumina.com/documents/products/technotes/technote_topbot.pdf[Illumina TOP strand]
convention to the forward strand (the `top` mode).

Run the stats to learn the number of REF allele mismatches and the number of 
non-biallelic sites:
----
bcftools +fixref test.bcf -- -f ref.fa
----

Another tool for checking the reference allele mismatches:
----
bcftools norm --check-ref e -f /path/to/reference.fasta input.vcf.gz -Ou -o /dev/null
----

If there are no REF mismatches and the number of multi-allelic sites is small, we are done.
If the output shows that the VCF is TOP-compatible, the following command can be
used to fix the strand:
----
bcftools +fixref test.bcf -Ob -o output.bcf -- -f ref.fa -m top
----


If the file contains dbSNP reference identificators (rsXXX in the ID column), the following
commands can be used to swap the reference and alternate alleles:
----
# Get the dbSNP annotation file. Make sure the correct reference build is used (e.g. b37)
#   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/docs/human_variation_vcf/
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606_b146_GRCh37p13/VCF/All_20151104.vcf.gz
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606_b146_GRCh37p13/VCF/All_20151104.vcf.gz.tbi

# Swap the alleles
bcftools +fixref broken.bcf -Ob -o fixref.bcf -- -d -f /path/to/reference.fasta -i All_20151104.vcf.gz

# The above command might have changed the coordinates, we must sort the VCF.
bcftools sort fixref.bcf -Ob -o fixref.sorted.bcf
----


In the most extreme case when nothing else is working, one can simply force
the unambigous alleles onto the forward strand and drop the ambigous genotypes.
----
bcftools +fixref test.bcf -Ob -o output.bcf -- -f ref.fa -m flip -d
----
**Note that this is an extremely unsafe operation and will most likely result in nonsense 
genotypes.** If you decide to use it anyway, make sure to **check the sanity of the
result** with the link:plugin.af-dist.html[af-dist plugin]!!

WARNING: **Do not use the program blindly, make an effort to understand what
strand convention your data uses! Make sure the reason for mismatching REF
alleles is not a different reference build!! Also do NOT use `bcftools norm --check-ref s` for this purpose,
as it will result in nonsense genotypes!!!**

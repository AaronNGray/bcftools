Plugin mendelian
----------------

This plugin is intended for detecting Mendelian inconsistencies. On input the program requires 
a valid VCF and a trio definition, for example:
----
$ bcftools +mendelian file.vcf -- -t mother,father,child
----

Multiple trios can be tested at once by providing a list of trios:
----
$ bcftools +mendelian file.vcf -- -T trios.txt
$ cat trios.txt
mother1,father1,child1
mother2,father2,child2
----

The inconsistent genotypes can be deleted by setting to `./.` (with the `-d, --delete` option),
inconsistent sites can be counted (give the `-c, --count` option) or listed (the `-l, --list` option).

On output three values are printed for each trio
----
# [1]nOK  [2]nBad  [3]nSkipped  [4]Trio
334518    4621     996          mother,father,child
----
where

- nOK .. number of genotypes at which the trio had no missingness and no Mendelian error
- nBad .. number of genotypes at which the trio had a Mendelian error
- nSkipped .. number of genotypes at which that trio had at least one individual missing and therefore could not be considered

The program takes the genotypes as they are, *not* considering genotype quality (FORMAT/GQ).
If pre-filtering is desired, the plugin ``setGT`` can be used.
